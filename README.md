# Magento Resources and Links
I have been looking for a good repository for all resources for Magento and I thought I will start putting them here for now. I am inspired by Alessandro Ronchi (https://twitter.com/aleron75) who has been putting out a list of resources.
- Magento 2 Docker images for extension testing - https://github.com/michielgerritsen/magento2-extension-integration-test
- MRM Commerce Magento 2 Coding Standard - https://github.com/mrm-commerce/magento-coding-standard-phpcs
- ConvertM1M2 - Convert M1 ext to M2 ext - https://github.com/unirgy/convertm1m2
- Magento Cheat sheets - https://cheatography.com/tag/magento/


# Magento Patches

Welcome to the Magento Patch Exchange. This is an effort to collect all the Magento patches in one spot for both EE and CE. I have been neglectful in properly maintaining this repo but I have made some recent efforts to merge pull requests, answer issues and submit the latest EE patches.

## Reference to patches here
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTbU9Bq130zrrsJwLIB9d8qnGfYZnkm4jBlfNaBF19M/edit#gid=192164130

## What to do?

If you have a patch that is not in this repo please open a pull request and I will merge the patch. If you see a patch that shouldnâ€™t be there or is just plain wrong, please tell me. I will investigate it and remove it if necessary.

## Issues

Please do not open a support ticket for your Magento site. The best place to get your Magento questions answered is here http://magento.stackexchange.com/
